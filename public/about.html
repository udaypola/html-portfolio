<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>“The computer is the most remarkable tool that we have ever come up with”. This quote by Steve Jobs accurately reflects my thoughts every time I pick up my smart-phone or laptop. These are the innovations that continuously evolve not only functionally, but also provide an infinite scope of creativity and logic in different ways of storing and presenting information. Similar to capturing the colors of a beautiful sunset, when I see different information services, I feel the same sense of exhilaration. It is this feeling, which to date, drives me to relentlessly pursue tough problems. And it is the passion for programming, combined with my desire to dig deeper into the working of various applications and technologies, which propels me to apply for Master in Information Systems.
</p>

<p>I have completed bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering in India. I started to develop an interest in IoT (Internet of Things) during my second-year when I saw the different applications in a Tech-fest. My interest in IoT led me to do some research on it. After understanding the base line of what IoT means, it grabbed my attention. I wanted to know more about IoT, so I started browsing online. I got to know about IoT online course offered by NPTEL (National Program on Technology Enhanced Learning) and enrolled to the course.
</p>

<p>During the research, I got to know that IoT was a part of Computer Sciences and that is when I decided to pursue in this field. As my studies continued, I took part in various computer courses like Java, Python, Oracle and HTML. These courses helped me realize my interest in Information Systems is immense and there is much to learn and understand.
</p>

<p>Beyond the classroom education, an internship at the Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) during my second year of bachelors reinforced my pursuit of a career in Computer Sciences. For the internship, I constructed a Fire Alert System using Embedded Systems. This portable device was meant to alert people in the case of fire. I added Bluetooth module and IoT to the project so that it can alert people at larger distances.
</p>

<p>Following my internship at ECIL, during my third year of bachelors, me and my classmate developed an Ambient Parameter Monitoring System which helps us in monitoring our surroundings wirelessly. We have included LoRa and Wi-Fi modules for long distance communications. In order to observe the readings in smart-phone we created an app using Kodular and linked it to Google Firebase. This app also provides the feature of turning the device On/Off.
</p>

<p>In my forth-year, me and my team have worked on Monocular Depth Estimation under the guidance of a Professor at our college. The main goal of the project is to classify items into categories and giving a depth map as an output for a input image. We used Python, Machine learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for coding and Google Collapse for execution. We also prepared a research paper along with our Professor for publishing. The title of the paper is “CNN Based Monocular Depth Estimation” ( Paper ID - 60 at ICMED 2021).
</p>

<p>Organizations have been crucial to my growth during college. In 2019, me and my team organized an event GRIET Model United Nations (MUN), where we had to do marketing, team management, financial management and logistics. In 2018 and 2019, my classmate and I organized and initiated a “Go Green” event in our college to advocate saving and planting more trees. I am also the member of IETE (Institute of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers) forum where we organized an event on “Electronics and the impact”, to show the public that electronic devices are an irreplaceable facet of our daily lives. Partaking and organizing these events taught me the importance of leadership and teamwork to complete tasks quickly and efficiently. With this I can say I have experience matching a leader and a co-operative team member.
</p>

<p>One key hobby I take pride in is sketching and painting, which I started as a child. I have done many drawing and paintings till date. This hobby has helped me exercise a unique thought process and develop the patience needed to meet perfection. Also, when encountering a problem, this creative aspect of my life helps me look for solution with creative and unconventional perspectives.
</p>

<p>Having acquired a solid foundation in the field of software and hardware through rigorous under-graduate program, at this point, I feel that it is right time to take up further graduate studies. My goal is to increase my knowledge in the field of Information Systems and use it towards a fulfilling career.
